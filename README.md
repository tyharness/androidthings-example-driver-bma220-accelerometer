# sample-bma220-accelerometer
Sample Driver for a Bosch BMA220 tri-axial acceleration sensor for Android Things Developer Preview 4 

This driver is not production ready.  At best it's a demo only.

For simplicity, I would reccomend you use the DFRobot modulue SKU:SEN0168  where the BMA220 i2c sensor has a slave address of 0x20.
